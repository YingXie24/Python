Fuel economy data is collected for testing at EPA's National Vehicle and Fuel Emissions Lab in Ann Arbor, Michigan. The EPA provides this data to the government each year, which the Department of Energy uses to publish their fuel economy guide. This data is available for download
[here](https://www.fueleconomy.gov/feg/download.shtml/).

This project uses data from 2008 and 2018.

# Data description

- *Model*	Vehicle make and model
- *Displ*	Engine displacement - the size of an engine in liters
- *Cyl*	The number of cylinders in a particular engine
- *Trans*	Transmission Type and Number of Gears
- *Drive*	Drive axle type (2WD = 2-wheel drive, 4WD = 4-wheel/all-wheel drive)
- *Fuel*	Fuel Type
- *Cert Region*	Certification Region Code
- *Sales Area*	Certification Region Code
- *Stnd*	Vehicle emissions standard code
- *Stnd Description*	Vehicle emissions standard description
- *Underhood ID*	This is a 12-digit ID number that can be found on the underhood emission label of every vehicle. It's required by the EPA to designate its "test group" or "engine family." This is explained more here
- *Veh Class*	EPA Vehicle Class
- *Air Pollution Score*	Air pollution score (smog rating)
- *City MPG*	Estimated city mpg (miles/gallon)
- *Hwy MPG*	Estimated highway mpg (miles/gallon)
- *Cmb MPG*	Estimated combined mpg (miles/gallon)
- *Greenhouse Gas Score*	Greenhouse gas rating
- *SmartWay*	Yes, No, or Elite
- *Comb CO2*	Combined city/highway CO2 tailpipe emissions in grams per mile

Cert Region is not included in 2008 dataset

Sales Area is not included in 2018 dataset

# Question we could ask about the data:
1. Are more models using alternative types of fuel? By how much?
2. How much have vehical classes improved fuel economy?
3. What are the characteristics of SmartWay vehicles?
4. What features are associated with better fuel economy?
5. For all the models that were produced in 2008 that are still being produced in 2018, how much has the mpg improved and which vehicle improved the most?
